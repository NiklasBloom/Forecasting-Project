Data:
daily prices and volumes of selected spdr etfs.

Goal:
To apply machine learning techniques to recommend a Sector ETF that is likely to be in the 50th percentile next-day returns. This involves predicting whether a given ETF will perform better than the median return of the group.

How:
Select an "TICKER_OF_INTEREST". For this ticker, we will calculate how often it is above the 50th percentile for returns (returns calculated as % change from previous day). Data is plotted, features are added, and data is split into training and testing data. I use three different sub-models, SVM(Support Vector Machine), random forest, and XGBoost. The predictions from these sub-models are then fed into a stacked neural network which takes these predictions to generate a final recommendation on the ETF likely to exceed the 50th percentile in next-day returns.

In the post-analysis the project involves calculating the predicted returns for the chosen "TICKER_OF_INTEREST" based on the stacked model's predictions. For each date where the model predicts the ETF to be above the 50th percentile, the corresponding forward returns are accumulated and averaged to estimate the mean predicted returns. Additionally, the mean returns for each ticker in the dataset are computed over the testing period to provide a comparative overview of performance across different ETFs.

Usefulness:
Historical Data Analysis: While the code doesnâ€™t forecast future returns, it does analyze historical data to identify patterns. This analysis can be useful for backtesting investment strategies or for educational purposes to understand how different factors might influence ETF performance.

Investment Strategy Development: Investors might use this type of analysis as part of a broader investment strategy. For example, understanding which ETFs frequently perform in the top 50th percentile could inform decisions about portfolio diversification or risk management.

Notes:
The SMA(simple moving average) and EMA(exponential moving averages) are features I added to the data. Its purpose is to help the machine learning model achieve more accurate results and they provide insights into the ETFs' trends and momentum, which are critical factors in financial time-series analysis.

Future:
Given more time, the analysis could be expanded by including additional features such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Fast Fourier Transform for more sophisticated trend and periodicity analysis. Enhancing the visualization of the results could also provide clearer insights and make the findings more accessible.

Beware:
A significant consideration in using this model is the risk of overfitting, which is where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. It is crucial to test the model across different economic periods and conduct thorough out-of-sample testing to ensure its robustness and reliability in various market conditions.
